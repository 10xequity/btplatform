# Boomtown Platform — CHANGELOG

## v0.1 — 2026-07-21 (Module 1: Foundation)
- Created D1 database `boomtown-prod` (WNAM) via Cloudflare MCP.
- Applied migration 0001: 23 tables, org_id + soft-delete everywhere, audit_log; seeded 3 orgs. Verified live.
- Worker API v0.1: magic-link auth (15-min single-use, hashed tokens), 30-day sessions (cookie + Bearer), first-user-becomes-admin bootstrap, roles, /api/orgs, audit logging, Brevo adapter with sandbox fallback.
- Frontend shell v0.1: spec §4 tokens (dark black/gold default, light white/navy), theme toggle, org switcher (2 clicks), login + dashboard, emil-design-eng motion rules, WCAG focus states, 44px targets, reduced-motion support.
- CI: GitHub Actions worker auto-deploy (needs CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN secret).
- Known gaps → v0.2: admin TOTP enforcement; real email (Brevo key); org-switch server-side role gating on future endpoints.

## v0.2 — 2026-07-21 (Module 3: Tournament Engine)
- Scheduler engine (worker/src/scheduler.js): format templates (7-on-3, 10-on-4, 11-on-5, 8/9-on-4, 4-on-2x2), feasibility pre-check with one-tap fixes, circle-method partial round-robin, court packing at optimal round counts, byes balanced ±1, ref rotation from byes, standings (wins → diff → head-to-head), A/BB brackets with best-of-3 21-21-15 semis/finals.
- Test suite (worker/test/scheduler.test.mjs): all formats assert no-rematch, no double-booking, bye spread ≤1, optimal rounds, tiebreaks, seeding. ALL PASSING.
- API (worker/src/tournaments.js): events CRUD, bulk team add, schedule generate (score-wipe protection), drag-edit PATCH with live warnings, 2-tap score endpoint, standings materialization, bracket break. Role-gated per org; audit-logged.
- UI (web/tournament.html/.css/.js): create-from-template ≤10 clicks, paste-in teams, feasibility banner with fix buttons, Court×Round grid with bye/work column, HTML5 drag-and-drop with amber warnings, bottom-sheet 2-tap scoring, standings table, bracket button, print pool sheet, CSV export.
- Feature addendum doc: commercial-parity backlog vs volleyballlife/gymdesk/mindbody.
